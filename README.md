## Acute renal failure is characterized clinically by an abrupt decrease in renal function over a period of hours to days due to azotemia. What is azotemia?

Azotemia is an elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels. The reference range for BUN is 8-20 mg/dL, and the normal range for serum creatinine is 0.7-1.4 mg/dL.

## What is the mechanism of action of streptokinase?

Streptokinase belongs to a group of medications known as Fibrinolytics or Thrombolytics and complexes of streptokinase with human plasminogen can hydrolytically activate other unbound plasminogen by activating through  bond cleavage to produce plasmin.

There are three domains to Streptokinase, denoted α (residues 1–150), β (residues 151–287), and γ (residues 288–414). Each domain binds plasminogen, although none can activate plasminogen independently
Plasmin is breaks down Fibrin, which is the major constituent of thrombus or blood clot.
The usual activation of Plasminogen  is by proteolysis of the Arg 561 – Val 562 bond.  The amino group of Val562 then forms a salt-bridge with Asp740, which triggers a conformational change producing the active protease Plasmin .

## What are the primary contributors COPD? Define these medical conditions?

The two primary causes of COPD are cigarette smoking and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. Air pollution and occupational dusts might also contribute to COPD, especially when the person exposed to these substances is a cigarette smoker. Genetic causes other than AAT deficiency are also likely to contribute.

Cigarette smoke causes COPD by irritating the airways and creating inflammation that narrows the airways, making it more difficult to breathe. Cigarette smoke also causes the cilia to stop working properly so mucus and trapped particles are not cleaned from the airways. As a result, chronic cough and excess mucus production develop, leading to chronic bronchitis.

In some people, chronic bronchitis and infections can lead to destruction of the small airways, or emphysema.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, an inherited disorder, can also lead to emphysema. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protective enzyme that is produced in the liver, secreted into the bloodstream from the liver cells, and then carried through the blood to the lungs to help fight inflammation.

When there is not enough AAT in the lung, the body is no longer protected from the tissue breakdown effects of an enzyme in the white blood cells. When the white blood cells go to the lung (for instance, in conditions of lung inflammation like smoking or dusty environments), they release these enzymes into the lung. This can cause a breakdown in the walls of the air sacs (alveoli). When the alveoli are destroyed, air passages of the lung can become blocked, oxygen cannot be transferred into the blood, and carbon dioxide cannot be taken from the blood to be exhaled.
